# Web app

Project we achieved in pair. The goal was to create a web-based application.
We choosed to create a website called xperience on which every student in the school
could review their internships during their second and third year. 
We manipulated html as markup language (also with css), MySQL to manage databases and
javascript, especially with google maps apis. 
The site is presented in "report_xperience_fr.pdf" and "presentation_xperience_fr.pdf".
