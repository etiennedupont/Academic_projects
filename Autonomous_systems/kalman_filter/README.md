# Designing a Kalman filter for a car in 2D

In this project, we implemented a Kalman filter to allow navigation of a car whose characteristics 
are detailled in the intructions. We designed two models of filters ; the first one is a simplified
version of a basic Kalman filter. The second one is an Extended Kalman filter with more features 
inputed into the parameter vector.
