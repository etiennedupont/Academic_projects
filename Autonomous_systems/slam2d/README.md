# Application of slam on a car in 2D 
In this project, we implemented a SLAM algorithm on a car that evolves on a 2D map and performs range-and-bearing measurements. The map contains several points that are potential landmarks for the car. The goal was then to tune the parameters of the Kalman Filter we used in order to obtain an efficient SLAM algorithm.
